# Hangman game 
Basic hangman game in Python done using Tkinter. Part of my Programming module's coursework (Exercise nr. 3).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites 

Make sure you have python and pip installed.

```
sudo apt-get install python
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
For Windows users, you can install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ .

(Make sure you tick the PATH option in the installer)

## Installing additional modules

Most of the modules used in this project, Tkinter and random are already pre-installed wtih Python. 

However, it is still necessary to install PIL: 

```
python3 -m pip install -U PIL --user
```

For Windows users, open a command prompt and type: (make sure you have added Python to your PATH variable!)

```
pip install PIL
```

# Running the program

In root folder run:

```
python ex3.py
```
